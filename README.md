Product Manager/Project Manager

I have worked on two startups within this company. The first startup was aimed at creating an application for truckers in the American market.

At the beginning of the internship, I worked as a product manager, and to implement this startup, I, along with the team, conducted a market analysis for the release of our product. Through interviews with stakeholders and potential consumers of this product, we collected information and assessed the market situation and risks. Also, in this role, it was important for me to make an assessment and identify risks and problems to management.

In addition, together with the design team, we developed a website for our product.
At the end of the internship, I switched to the role of project manager and among my key responsibilities were: assigning tasks to the team, evaluating the work of each team member and setting deadlines for completing tasks. After tracking the completion of tasks and deadlines

The second startup was innovative and aimed at implementing AI for the Israeli museum dedicated to the victims of the Holocaust. In it, I coordinated the work of colleagues, formed a summary of data and designed them for presentation. And she also offered her own options for using AI to modernize and improve the museum.
