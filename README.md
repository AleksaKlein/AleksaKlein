## Innovation through Collaboration 

I am a project manager. I like to view a project management as a part of something greater. I use my knowledge to define priority tasks. A favorite part of my job is when you meet deadlines ahead of schedule and accomplish key objectives. I am resposible person which think outside the box. I am communicative and I realy enjoy to work with people and specialist team.
